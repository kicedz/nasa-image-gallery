   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the following variables:

   ```env
   CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID=your_contentful_space_id
   CONTENTFUL_TOKEN=your_contentful_access_token
   CONTENTFUL_MANAGEMENT_TOKEN=your_contentful_management_token
   CONTENTFUL_PREVIEW_TOKEN=your_contentful_preview_token
   NEXT_USE_SSR=1
   NASA_API_KEY=your_nasa_api_key
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   OPENAI_PROJECT_ID=your_openai_project_id
   ```

   **Note:** Replace the placeholder values with your actual API keys and tokens. **Do not commit `.env.local` to version control.**

4. **Run the Development Server**

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.
